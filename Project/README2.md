Mozart Food Symphony
(The perfood harmony) perfect + food = perfood ?
Taste Affinities

# Abstract

Have you ever wondered while cooking whether these ingredients could be great together ? A good example is certaintly the hawaiian pizza(Ham + pineaple)

Thus, using the big dataset gathering cooking recipes all around the world, our project's goal is to extract the combination of ingredients and try to find an interconnection between them.

First of all, the firt step will be to extract the essence of each ingredient in a recipe and then analyse what the ingredient bring to the recipe (sweet, spicy, ...). 
The second step, will be to find correlation between recipes in order to map which combinations of different ingredients blend the best together to give tasteful meals. 
Finally, we imagine an interface where users will give as input a series of ingredients and constraints, i.e. (vegan, with meat, with fish, etc.) and a recipe will be suggested to them. From there we can use machine learning to create new recipes from what we have learned. Theoretically, this mechanism will consider all ingredients seen in the learning phase, thus new unknown mixtures of ingredients can emerge giving rise to the best recipe ever (hopefully).
To achieve our goals, we will use Cooking recipes dataset, where we can get the list of ingredients, ingredients bag of words, ingredient categories, the total amount of calories and the calories by group, i.e. fat, protein, sugar, as well as the sodium and cholesterol content.

Story: 
We believe that ingredients in a recipe are like harmonies in music, separated they are pleasant to hear, but when perfectly combined harmonies can come up with something special (Schubert' Symphonies).
Therefore, we are convinced that the best combinations have never been done and also that special combinations have yet to be found. 
Indeed, best chef in the world always tries when making a creation, to have all ingredients in osmosis. What if the best combination is a fish from Tahti, a spice from Tierra del Fuego, some exotic vegetable from Vietnam and olive oil from Italy. How would be able to produce it?     

Motivation: We are three students that enjoy cooking and eating, however, as students, it's not always easy to take the time to check for a recipe, look at the ingredients we already have and what we are missing. Also, it's not easy to have new ideas or to know whether what are left in our fridges could be cooked together. We believe this project is a good idea, to speed up process, indeed one would need to give as input the ingredients and a new tasty recipe would pop up.



# Research questions
## A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.



# Dataset
## List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.




# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
## Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.
The project milestone should contain a notebook with data collection and descriptive analysis.

Week #1 :
- Agree on the dataset and what information to extract
- Discuss with the TA about our work plan.
- Find function to handle text extraction (only important words, without articles words such as the, a, for ...)

Week #2 :
- Data collection
- Find correlation to answer the questions

Week #3 :
- Work on a possible data story
- Work on the descriptive analysis
Week #4
- Finalise the notebook
- Structured and informed plan for the next milestones.
- Start to work on our data story or report
- Start to discuss about the presentation for the poster

# Questions for TAa
Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.
- The wikipedia corpus is also present on the site. Will we be allowed to use it?

- We will need powerful tools of natural language processing to analyse the meaning of the articles. Is it doable?
