# Title
Healthy Habits

# Abstract
## A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
Our goal is to extract information about healthy pattern in a dataset. More precisely we would like to found articles with health related subject, rate their importance and get more specific information. For example We could then plot a health impact in term of different  discrete "problems": fast food, gluten, etc.. by region and by period if possible. 
Secondly we would like to see if new problem have appeared and other dissapeared or have been solved. It would be possible to analyse this by finding sudden increase/decrease in frequency of specific terms.

Story:

Motivation:
-If would be very interesting to see if some problems appeared / dissapeared in some part of the world before other.
-How did our percpetion of healthy has evolved ? (When a developing country becomes a developed country people can focus on different problems. Before the bottom of the pyramid is fullfilled it is not possible to address problems in the top of the pyramid)
