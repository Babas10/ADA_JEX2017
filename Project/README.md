# Title
Healthy Habits

# Abstract
## A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
Our goal is to extract information about healthy pattern in a dataset. More precisely we would like to found articles with health related subject, rate their importance and get more specific information. For example We could then plot a health impact in term of different  discrete "problems": fast food, gluten, etc.. by region and by period if possible. 
Secondly we would like to see if new problem have appeared and other dissapeared or have been solved. It would be possible to analyse this by finding sudden increase/decrease in frequency of specific terms.

Story:
-

Motivation:
-If would be very interesting to see if some problems appeared / dissapeared in some part of the world before other.
-How did our percpetion of healthy has evolved ? (When a developing country becomes a developed country people can focus on different problems. Before the bottom of the pyramid is fullfilled it is not possible to address problems in the top of the pyramid)



# Research questions
## A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- What are important health issues of the 21st century?
- Impact of different behaviour/habits on health?
- Malnutrition, undernourishment or overconsumption of specific food could hqve an impact on the health issues.

# Dataset
## List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

-News On the Web : Bigger dataset and information is spreaded accross many regions

-200 years of News : Information more localized but can be a strength whether our project wants to identify the questions on country scale.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
## Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.
The project milestone should contain a notebook with data collection and descriptive analysis.

Week #1 : 
- Agree on the dataset and what information to extract
- Discuss with the TA about our work plan.
- Find function to handle text extraction (only important words, without articles words such as the, a, for ...)

Week #2 :
- Data collection
- Find correlation to answer the questions

Week #3 :
- Work on a possible data story
- Work on the descriptive analysis
Week #4
- Finalize the notebook
- Structured and informed plan for the next milestones.
- Start to work on our data story or report
- Start to discuss about the presentation fo the poster

# Questions for TAa
