# Title
Spreading of Trends
# Abstract
## A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
We are interested in analysing the spreading of a new "trend" for example being Gluten free. By localising first reference to it in the news and analysing the following references. The "trend" can be detected by using reference words as "Health". Indeed by looking new association to reference words could help us to detect trends. Furthermore, it would be possible to see which regions /country follows the trends of others if it always comes from the same place and the rapidity of the evolution in relation with the "theme" of the trend. This process can be generalise to further subject as crisis (economic propagation), revolutions(sharing new ideas), etc.

# Research questions
## A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
-Is Gluten free a trend or was it always there?
-Are new ideas always coming from the same place?
-Did the internet and the digitalisation increased the rapidity of propagation of ideas?
